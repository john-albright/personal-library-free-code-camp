# [Personal Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library)

This project is the third of five projects completed for FreeCodeCamp's sixth (final JavaScript) certificate: [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/#advanced-node-and-express). The Personal Library's [assignment instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker) and [starter code on GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-library) were provided by FreeCodeCamp. A live demo of the project can be found on [Replit](https://replit.com/@john-albright/personal-library-free-code-camp).

The application was created with Express.js (a Node.js framework) to record the books in a personal library. Tests for the program were written in Chai.js (with some cleanup hookups written in Mocha.js). GET, DELETE, and POST requests can be made to the routes /api/books/ and /api/books/id.
